# Visual Design of COOKR
This is the visual design and (some) functional design that Sofi Flink and Elias Rudberg came up with through 
'research. All sources will be displayed here.

## Functionality Correlating to Design
Cooking is somewhat some part of everyones everyday life. Therefore we want to create an including app for everyone.
This is some of the sources that we will be taking into account while designing the app.

* [HaptiMap](https://moodle.lth.se/pluginfile.php/38920/mod_resource/content/1/HaptiMap%20example%20apps.pdf) on page 31,
how to make including button design for everyone. Possible to let blind people make us of the app (probably mostly the timer).

* [Ljud och Metod](https://moodle.lth.se/pluginfile.php/43550/mod_resource/content/1/Ljud%20o%20metod.pdf) Lecture notes on
using sounds as a way of informing the user of different actions and processes in a product. No conclusions yet, also touches on the subject above if we want to convert words to sounds.
* [Gestures](https://moodle.lth.se/pluginfile.php/43103/mod_resource/content/1/Gestures.pdf), lecture on gestures. Since it is
"A step backwards in usability" (Norman & Nielsen) we will need a tutorial or guide in the main meny easy accessible.
* [Experiences Before Things:](https://moodle.lth.se/pluginfile.php/38884/mod_resource/content/1/p2059-hassenzahl.pdf) A Primer for the (Yet) Unconvinced. We need a way to verify the user experience in the later stages of process. Since we prefer a good experience over a product. If the user has a good experience while interacting with the app the chances are higher for the user to return and use the app again. OPT: Do we want to have the possibility to take a photo of the finished course in the app? Store user data on reviews and pictures of the finished recipe? Possible to interact with other user regarding cooking. (Or we want to keep it simple and functional, where the app only becomes the background for a good experience, cooking food, is there a way to make cooking together more fun using the app?). In the western world where the materialistic world is easy accessible and affordable, experiences tend to be valued a lot higher. There is probably some correlation to how individuals in industrialized countries, with high standards of living, values self fullfillment more than anything. It is also at the same time harder for the indivudal to conceptualize what their role in this is and is probably another reason for higher rates of depression and suicide. Individuals today expect more from life, since there are an uncountable amount of options, but the road is not clear.

## Visual Design
This section will contain some data on why we have picked different visual design options.

### Color Theme

* [Consumer preferences for color combinations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1057740810000793), this article came up with three key findings: First, people de-emphasize lightness and focus on hue and saturation. Second, given this shift in emphasis, people generally like to combine colors that are relatively close or exactly match, with the exception that some people highlight one signature product component by using contrastive color. Third, a small palette principle is supported such that the total number of colors used in the average design was smaller than would be expected under statistical independence.   
From this, we can draw the conclusion that the color theme nees to have a small palette with lightness hue and saturation of colors close to each other. To make something pop in the design you can use a contrasive color.
