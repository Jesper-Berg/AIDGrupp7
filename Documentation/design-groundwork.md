# Visual Design of COOKR
This is the visual design and (some) functional design that Sofi Flink and Elias Rudberg came up with through 
'research. All sources will be displayed here.

## Including target design
Cooking is somewhat some part of everyones everyday life. Therefore we want to create an including app for everyone.
This is some of the sources that we will be taking into account while designing the app.

how to make including button design for everyone. Possible to let blind people make us of the app (probably mostly the timer).
